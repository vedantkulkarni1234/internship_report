## üöÄ Core Features

*   **Intuitive GUI**: A beautiful, modern dark-themed interface built with Tkinter.
*   **Drag & Drop**: Easily drag and drop images directly into the application.
*   **Dual Mode**:
    *   **Hide Data**: Embed text messages or entire files within images.
    *   **Extract Data**: Recover the hidden information from stego-images.
*   **Multi-Algorithm Support**: Choose from a variety of steganography techniques:
    *   **LSB (Least Significant Bit)**: Classic and simple.
    *   **Adaptive LSB**: Intelligently varies the number of bits used based on image complexity.
    *   **DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform)**: More robust against compression.
    *   **DWT (Discrete Wavelet Transform)**: Offers higher data hiding capacity and robustness.
    *   **Spread Spectrum**: Highly resistant to detection and removal attempts.
*   **Strong Encryption**: Secure your hidden data with password-based AES encryption (using PBKDF2 for key derivation).

## üõ°Ô∏è Advanced Forensics & Recovery Suite

StealthyData isn't just for hiding data; it's also a powerful tool for digital investigation.

*   **Data Recovery**:
    *   **Error Correction**: Attempt to recover data from corrupted images by cycling through different algorithms.
    *   **Partial Recovery**: Salvage readable fragments from heavily damaged data.
    *   **Brute-Force**: Automatically try a list of common passwords to decrypt data.
*   **Image Repair**:
    *   Fix minor corruption in stego-images using various filtering and enhancement techniques (Median, Gaussian, etc.).
*   **Forensic Analysis**:
    *   **Basic Analysis**: Get metadata, timestamps, and file properties.
    *   **Deep Scan**: Perform advanced statistical tests (Chi-Square, Pair Analysis, RS Analysis) to detect the presence of hidden data.
    *   **LSB Entropy Analysis**: Check for unusual randomness in the least significant bits, a common sign of steganography.
*   **Brute-Force Protection**: The extraction process includes a simulated rate-limiter to demonstrate protection against password guessing attacks.
*   **Evidence Chain**:
    *   Generate and verify data integrity reports (hashes, timestamps) for forensic evidence chains.

## üìñ How to Use

### To Hide Data

1.  **Launch** the application.
2.  Go to the **Hide Data** tab.
3.  **Drag & drop** your cover image or click **Browse Image**.
4.  **Select the Data Type**: "Text Message" or "File".
5.  **Input your data**:
    *   If "Text Message", type your secret message.
    *   If "File", click "Browse" to select the file you want to hide.
6.  **Choose an Algorithm** (e.g., LSB, DCT).
7.  **(Optional but Recommended)** Check **"Encrypt data with password"** and enter a strong password.
8.  Click the **"Hide Data in Image"** button.
9.  **Save** the new stego-image to your desired location.

### To Extract Data

1.  **Launch** the application.
2.  Go to the **Extract Data** tab.
3.  **Drag & drop** the stego-image or click **Browse Stego Image**.
4.  **Select the Algorithm** that was used to hide the data.
5.  If the data was encrypted, check **"Data is encrypted"** and enter the correct password.
6.  Click the **"Extract Hidden Data"** button.
7.  The extracted message will appear in the text box. If a file was extracted, you'll be prompted to save it.
